# Windows Modules

This folder contains a dummy executable which is used to ensure the build for `net8.0-windows7.0` is performed, so the `Duplicati.Library.WindowsModules` project is compiled and dependent libraries are pulled into the build.

The executable itself is not included in the final packaged build output.
