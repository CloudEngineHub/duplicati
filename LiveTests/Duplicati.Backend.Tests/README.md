# Environment variables for tests

On Github actions these are mapped 1:1 to secrets, even the non password fields are stored in secrets.

## General

These control the size and number of files generated.

```
MAX_FILE_SIZE    default is 1000kb
NUMBER_OF_FILES  default is 20
```

## Backends that do not require Environment variables

- FTP _(TestContainers required)_
- SSH _(TestContainers required)_
- Webdav _(TestContainers required)_
- CIFS _(TestContainers required)_

Please note that TestContainers token has to be configured in secrets/Github actions yml.

## Backends that require Environment variables

# iDrivee2

```
TESTCREDENTIAL_IDRIVEE2_BUCKET

```

## Backblaze B2

Backblaze B2 credentials are mapped to the following environment variables:

```
TESTCREDENTIAL_B2_BUCKET
TESTCREDENTIAL_B2_FOLDER
TESTCREDENTIAL_B2_USERNAME
TESTCREDENTIAL_B2_PASSWORD
```

## Google Drive:

```

## pCloud Native API

```
TESTCREDENTIAL_PCLOUD_SERVER
TESTCREDENTIAL_PCLOUD_TOKEN
TESTCREDENTIAL_PCLOUD_FOLDER
```

For PCloud the server is the API server(eapi.pcloud.com for EU hosted account or api.pcloud.com for non EU). The token is the OAuth token.

## Running the tests

[TestContainers](https://testcontainers.org/) is a pre-requisite for SSH, FTP and Webdav tests. It is not required for the other tests.

Set the environment variables as described above, then run the tests using the following commands:

Minimal Verbosity:

`dotnet test Duplicati.Backend.Tests.sln --logger:"console;verbosity=normal"`

Running with full verbosity (useful if tests are failing):

`dotnet test Duplicati.Backend.Tests.sln --logger:"console;verbosity=detailed"`

Running specific tests:

`dotnet test Duplicati.Backend.Tests.sln --logger:"console;verbosity=detailed" --filter="Name=TestDropBox"`
